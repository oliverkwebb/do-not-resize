    <p>UI design is more often than not made harder by the burden of having to resize windows. Responsiveness is a huge issue users
    impart on developers. Thus, this letter calls to keep your window in conventional aspect ratios (ideally, a constant one we can set).</p>
    <p>Remember when you reach for the edge of a window to drag it out that you aren't resizing your window, you're resizing our window.</p>
    <br>
    <div class="point">
      <img src="assets/picard.png" class="point-image">
      <p><b>Narrow windows</b> can hide apps features and cut off information. Causing people to have to scroll or worse.
    </div>

    <div class="point">
      <img src="assets/cssrules.png" class="point-image">
      <p><b>Differing aspect ratios</b> often require custom layouts to handle them cleanly</p>
    </div>

    <div class="point">
      <img src="assets/naut.png" class="point-image">
      <p><b>Padding and a lack of information density</b> are essential features to the modern UI. People can be persuaded to make UI's more compact for support for older display hardware.</p>
    </div>
    <br>

    <p>More auxiliary issues exist:</p>

    <p><b>Personalization is personal.</b> People who prefer the apps at different sizes will have different experiences navigating the UI.
    This wider attack surface can create unforeseen problems, and it can also confuse users and dirty otherwise pristine interfaces.</p>

    <p>If your UI library gives the capability to people to make their apps truly theirs, it will interfere with our plans for the apps.</p>

    <p><b>Differences in distance and size</b> may confuse people looking at screenshots of UI's. The human mind works like <code>xdotool</code>, and instructions like "720px, 140px" are more readable than "Next to the save button"</p>

    <br>

    <p><b>This is why we ask respectfully that our windows not be resized</b>. They are built and tested for 16:9 1080p, and occasionally phone aspect ratios. Different sizes and layouts will make the application look different.</p>

    <p>Though we are working towards the initiative of restricting resizing functionality in GUI libraries, this issue
    can not be dealt with in its entirety right now.</p>

    <p>The challenge we face is that users launch our apps with the expectation that they will be able to drag it out or split it with
    another window. And a broader idea of aspect ratio <!-- freedom --> flexibility, this has never been completely true.</p>

    <p><b>If you like personalizing your window sizes</b>. We have nothing against that, however, if your UI goes haywire deviating from the supported
    aspect ratio or size, it should be fixed on your own accord.</p>

    <p><b>Graphical Displays and corresponding software for them</b> should stay at one fixed size, instead of varying sizes. Solving this issue is very complicated and would damage many forms of accessibility, but devices varying screen size widely is also bad.</p>

    <p><b>If you are a shipping hardware with an unconventional window size</b>: first consider that you are not shipping your default software on
    that hardware, you are shipping <b>our</b> software on that hardware. Microsoft and Apple usually do not allow their software to be warped in such
    ways. And your actions are damaging to not just your users, but us.</p>
    <!-- I'm keeping this in comments, this idea and weird possessiveness, emphasized here, is what open source is actively supposed to prevent.
    	Changing third-party apps without any QA is reckless, and would be unacceptable on any other platform. Your actions are hurting us app developers a great deal, and are damaging to the entire ecosystem beyond your distribution. !-->

    <p>We understand the desire for personalization, especially on platforms people use to have more flexibility such as linux. However, when you drag "your" window out, you take away power from <b>us</b>. <!-- I'd retain half this paragraph, including the whole thing from this sentence on, if I felt it right to. --> It forces us to consider more edge cases and write more code, when things go wrong it forces us to make more bugfixes. Just because we use UI libraries with the ability to resize does not mean we are okay with you resizing <b>our</b> windows.</p>
